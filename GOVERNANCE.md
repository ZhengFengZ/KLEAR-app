# KLEAR Governance Model

## Summary / Overview
KLEAR is a free, open-source, powerful tool for working with messy data. KLEAR has a [plugin architecture](https://klear.org/docs/technical-reference/writing-extensions) and is distributed under the [new BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) allowing modification, distribution and name changes.

## Roles and responsibilities
KLEAR is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project based on the [Apache Decision Making process](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html).

In so far that is possible, decision-making is done based on user consensus following open discussion (i.e., using KLEAR's [discussion forum](https://forum.klear.org/) and [issue list](https://github.com/KLEAR/KLEAR/issues?state=open)). No major decisions about the project’s direction, bug fixes, or features should be made in private without community involvement and participation. Discussions must begin at the earliest possible point on a topic; the community’s participation is vital during the entire decision-making process.

All project participants abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/KLEAR/KLEAR/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Users
Users are community members who have a need for the project. Through their usage, they give the project a purpose. Users are encouraged to participate in the project life by providing feedback on how their needs are satisfied.

Users can help the project by:

- Advertising and advocating for the project
- Informing developers of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool through the [user discussion list](https://forum.klear.org/) or the [issue list](https://github.com/KLEAR/KLEAR/issues?state=open)
- Providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
- Writing tutorials to contextualize KLEAR for specific communities

### Contributors
Contributors are users getting involved in the project more closely. Contributions can take many forms:

- Supporting new users via the [user discussion forum](https://forum.klear.org/c/support/12)
- Submitting patches to fix bugs or add features via pull requests, commenting on pull requests and helping other contributors via the [developer discussion list](https://forum.klear.org/c/dev/8)
- Maintaining and improving the [website](https://klear.org/)
- Writing and maintaining the [documentation](https://github.com/KLEAR/klear.org/tree/master/docs)

Only eligible voters have a binding vote. Votes are expressed as
- +1: yes

The results must be positive for the person to be elected.

# Policies
This section does NOT cover KLEAR project governance. It is currently maintained in this `GOVERNANCE.md` file temporarily until another document or location can hold this information and make it transparent to the community.
 
The **Code of Conduct Committee, Advisory Committee, and Core Developer Group** hold greater authority within the KLEAR project, with the ability to represent and make commitments on its behalf. To maintain the community’s trust, these groups are held to a higher standard of transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes.
This includes transparent and open practices for:
- Requesting and managing funds
- Managing conflicts of interest

## Funding Application
KLEAR welcomes and encourages contributions and fundraising efforts from individuals and organizations. However, committees with additional authority over the project; namely the Core Dev Group, Advisory Committee, and Project Manager, have an increased responsibility to ensure transparency in funding applications.

This policy provides guidelines to uphold openness and accountability in fundraising efforts. It applies specifically when funds are managed by Code for Science & Society (CS&S).

While the vast majority of KLEAR contributors are volunteers, the Advisory Committee recognize the need to attract and retain contributors to help:
- Perform time-critical maintenance tasks for the project.
- Address issues that the community will not naturally do.

From a funding perspective, the Advisory Committee distinguish between restricted and unrestricted funds.

### Unrestricted funds (donations)
Unrestricted funds are not linked to a specific deliverable or usage and usually come from donations. The Advisory Committee decides how to use these funds based on the budget requests from Contributors.

### Restricted funds (grants)
Restricted funds are attached to specific deliverables or budget assignments from the grantors and usually come from grant applications. The Advisory Committee must approve grant applications by formal vote before submitting them.

Any contributor can initiate a grant application as a Principal Investigator (PI). The PI
- Must start a new thread with a subject line starting with `[Grant Opportunity:]` on the forum section named [Community Feedback](https://forum.klear.org/c/community/feedback/2) to collect feedback from the community. 
- Must be coordinated with the Advisory Committee.
- Will hire and supervise the contractors with the support of the Advisory Committee.
- Must collaborate with other KLEAR Members (and related working groups) regarding the grant scope.
- Complete any reporting required by the funder.
- Publish the grant application, status and reporting on [KLEAR website](https://klear.org/funding).

Grants can be used for:
- Specific feature development.
- Securing a maintainer or release manager position to ensure the community's support is ensured.
- Organize or attend events.

Contractors and employees hired via a restricted fund will:
- Prioritize work relevant to the grant funding their position
- Contribute to conversations revolving around general maintenance and operations
- Spend their remaining time contributing to general maintenance and operations

## Conflict of Interest
In the event of any conflict of interest (a Committee Member, their family member, or someone with whom the Committee Member has a close academic or employment relationship is involved in a decision), the Committee Member must immediately notify other Committee Members. The Committee Members will be asked to recuse themselves from ongoing conversations and decision processes regarding the Transaction.

## Advisory Committee Policies
Advisory Committee members:
- Represent KLEAR with Code for Science and Society (CS&S)
  - CS&S requires that there be an advisory committee and that the project pay no more than 49% of the committee.
  - CS&S requires the committee to be at least three people.
  - Every member of the Advisory Committee must sign the fiscal sponsorship agreement with CS&S, agreement, and agree to the policies of CS&S.
  - Must supervise (manage pay and review performance) paid project staff or delegate to the Project Manager.
- Manage Budget & Contract
  - Approve budget and oversee grant and financial activities
  - Approve grant applications
  - Enter into contracts on behalf of the project
  - Oversee contract and legal engagement for the project
- Participate in at least one call per quarter;
- Publish minutes of their meeting on [the forum](https://forum.klear.org/tag/minute-advisory)
- Advisory Committee members are subject to the Conflict of Interest policy.

## Fiscal sponsorship: Code For Science and Society
Since January 2020, KLEAR is a member project of [Code For Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/) (CS&S). CS&S provides administrative, legal and fiscal infrastructure to receive and manage funds under the CS&S Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement.
- CS&S retains a 15% handling fee on any donation to finance their operations (20% for government funding).
- CS&S owns and manages the domain klear.org

CS&S is a USA-based organization qualified as exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and classified as a public charity under IRC Sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(vi).
